Libraries
=========

You will need the following installed:
* Gtk2
* GLFW
* GLEW
* OpenGL

On Mac I used homebrew to install the packages.  On Arch linux I used pacman.


Compile
=======

make mac

or

make linux


Config file
===========

In the tarball in the etc directory there is a file:
rb-vis.conf

Copy this to either /etc/rb-vis.conf or ~/.rb-vis.conf and edit it so the
paths to the visualisers are correct.  If the visualiers are in your PATH then
Rubber Marbles will find them without specifying paths.


Install
=======

sudo make install

will copy the binaries to /usr/local/bin and the etc/rb-vis.conf file to /etc.
